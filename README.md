Internship Report on Bash Script


 Overview
This bash script provides a menu-driven interface for a variety of cybersecurity tools and tasks. The script is divided into six main categories: Information Gathering, Vulnerability Assessment, Web Application Analysis, Password Attacks, Exploitation Tools, and Sniffing and Spoofing. Each category further includes specific tools and actions related to that 
Category.
Objective
Develop a bash script with a user-friendly menu interface for cybersecurity tools.
Enhance scripting, tool integration, and documentation skills.
Foster effective teamwork and collaboration.

 Categories and Tools

 1. Information Gathering
This section allows the user to gather information using various tools.
- Nmap: A network scanning tool.
- Recon-Ng: A full-featured web reconnaissance framework.
- The Harvester: A tool for gathering email accounts, subdomains, hosts, employee names, open ports, and banners from different public sources.
- Hping3: A network tool able to send custom TCP/IP packets.
- Back: Navigate back to the main menu.

 2. Vulnerability Assessment
This section provides tools to assess vulnerabilities in systems.
- Wireshark: A network protocol analyzer.
- Nikto: A web server scanner.
- Nmap: Also used here for vulnerability assessment.

 3. Web Application Analysis
Tools for analyzing web applications.
- Burpsuite: An integrated platform for performing security testing of web applications.
- Nikto: Used here as well for web application scanning.
- Dirbuster: A multi-threaded application for brute-forcing directories and file names on web servers.

 4. Password Attack
Tools used for various types of password attacks.
- John The Ripper: A fast password cracker.
- Dirbuster: Also used here for directory brute-forcing.
- HashCat: A password recovery tool.
- Hydra: A tool for cracking passwords.
- Ophcrack: A Windows password cracker based on Rainbow Tables.

 5. Exploitation Tools
Tools for exploiting vulnerabilities in systems.
- Metasploit Framework: A tool for developing and executing exploit code against a remote target machine.
- Sqlmap: An open-source penetration testing tool that automates the process of detecting and exploiting SQL injection flaws.
- Beef: The Browser Exploitation Framework Project.

 6. Sniffing And Spoofing
Tools for network sniffing and spoofing.
- Wireshark: Also listed here for network protocol analysis.
- Tcpdump: A powerful command-line packet analyzer.
- Zaproxy: A penetration testing tool for finding vulnerabilities in web applications.

 Script Structure

 Main Menu
The main menu prompts the user to choose one of the six main categories. Based on the user's choice, a corresponding submenu is displayed with specific tools for that category.

 Submenus
Each category has its submenu with options for different tools. Users can select a tool, and the script will either run the tool directly or prompt the user for additional options before execution.

 Error Handling
The script includes basic error handling to manage invalid options, ensuring the user is notified when an incorrect choice is made.

 Script Code
 Usage Instructions

1. Run the Script: Execute the script in a terminal.
    ```bash
    ./script_name.sh
    ```
2. Main Menu: The script will display the main menu with six categories.
3. Submenus: Select a category to see the corresponding submenu.
4. Tool Execution: Choose a tool from the submenu and provide any required options.
5. Error Handling: If an invalid option is selected, the script will display an "Invalid Option" message and prompt again.
ConclusionðŸŽ¯
This script serves as a convenient interface for various cybersecurity tasks, allowing users to easily access and execute different tools from a single menu. By following the usage instructions, users can perform information gathering, vulnerability assessments, web application analysis, password attacks, exploitation, and sniffing and spoofing efficiently.
